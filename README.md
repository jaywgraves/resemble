# resemble

`resemble` is a command line tool (initially) that given an example image, will return a list of images in the same directory that are the most similar by using a [perceptual hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing) algorithm.

I wrote it to make it easier to find screen shots of the same application taken over time.
